Algorithm to caluclate the gibbs free energy differences between folded and unfolded conformation of RNA molecules


The algorithm in this repository calculculates Gibbs Free Energy values for RNA molecules. 
It takes the RNA sequence (in form of a string) and the secondary structure of the sequence (in form of dot-bracket anotation) as input and provides amount of Gibb's Free Energy lost through this conformation (compared to the unfolded sequence) as output. 

How to get started: *will be added soon*.

The free enthalpy losses produced by the installation of various secondary structures in the RNA molecule are retrieved from a set of nearest neighbor parameters calculated by the Turner group. Free energy and free enthalpy changes have been estimated by the group.

This code was written long time ago by me in course of my bachelor's thesis. Now, that already many years passed I decided to learn programming. As a start I created this repository to learn how to manage it and I'll try to make my old code smoother.
